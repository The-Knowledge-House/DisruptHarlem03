	<h2> About Me </h2>
	<p>My name is Cassandra L. Pierre-Louis</p>
	<p>I am passionate about service</p>
	<p>I'm hoping that through this program, I can learn some programming skills that I can put to use in my field of study, and I hope to tranfer these skills to my peers, as well as those who are younger than I am.</p>
