	<h2>Capote & Lee: In Cold Blood</h2>
	<h4>This website contains two site pages of two of the most prolific authors of the 1960s: Truman Capote and Harper Lee.</h4>
	<h4>Both of them were amazing authors in their own rigts, and worked in different genres</h4>
	<h4>They were linked through their friendship.</h4>
	<h4>After having achieving much success in their respective careers, <a href="harper_lee.html"> Lee</a> later helped <a href="truman_capote.html">Capote</a> write a story together about the killings of four members of a Kansas family in the 1960s.</h4>
	<h4>A movie was later made depicting the friendship between the two, and their creative and investigative writing process.</h4>
