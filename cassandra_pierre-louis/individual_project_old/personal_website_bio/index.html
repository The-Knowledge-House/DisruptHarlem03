	<h2> About Me </h2>
	<p>My name is Cassandra L. Pierre-Louis.</p>
	<p>I am passionate about service.</p>
	<p>I'm hoping that through this program, I can learn some programming skills that I can put to use in my field of study.</p>
	<p>I hope to eventually tranfer these skills to my peers, as well as children in inner-cities, or elsewhere, who otherwise wouldn't have access to a technical education.</p>
